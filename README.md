The primary goal of this Big Data Capstone Project is to develop and implement data-driven strategies to maximize the earning potential and operational efficiency of taxi drivers. By leveraging a large dataset of historical taxi trip records, we analyze key factors—including demand patterns, route efficiency, and driving practices—that influence a driver's total income. The outcome is a scalable data pipeline and a suite of analytical models providing actionable insights for optimizing driver deployment and trip selection.

## The 5 Use Cases for Optimization

"My project was structured around five distinct use cases, moving from descriptive analysis to advanced prediction, all aimed at one goal: maximizing driver revenue.

## 1.Driving Practice Optimization: 
Goal: Determine which factors most directly affect revenue.

Approach: Correlation analysis on financial variables.

## 2.Route Optimization: 
Goal: Identify high-value routes with the best return on distance.

Approach: Calculate Average Earnings per Kilometer per route pair (e.g., Manhattan to Queens).

## 3.Demand Prediction: 
Goal: Forecast hourly and daily trip volumes to guide driver deployment.

Approach: Time-series analysis and aggregation by hour/day.

## 4.Idle & Wait Time Reduction: 
Goal: Pinpoint specific low-demand time windows for scheduled downtime.

Approach: Detailed analysis of trip density across all 24 hours.

## 5.Earnings Prediction Model: 
Goal: Provide drivers with a reliable estimate of potential income before accepting a trip.

Approach: Regression modeling (Linear Regression) using trip features as input."
